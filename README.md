üöÄ Project Overviews
1. Tic Tac Toe AI

An interactive game where you can play Tic Tac Toe against an intelligent agent.

    Features: Classic 3x3 board, play as X or O, AI can make optimal moves using Minimax or similar algorithms.

    Tech: Python or JavaScript, AI algorithms.

    Learning: Game state modeling, decision trees, turn-based logic.

2. Face Detection

A computer vision project for detecting human faces in images or webcam streams.

    Features: Detects one or more faces, draws bounding boxes, can be used for basic recognition.

    Tech: OpenCV, Haar cascades or other ML models.

    Learning: Image processing, classifiers, computer vision basics.

3. AI Chatbot

A simple chatbot that responds to basic user queries.

    Features: Text-based chat, pattern matching or simple NLP, customizable conversation flows.

    Tech: Python (regex, NLTK) or JavaScript, basic natural language understanding.

    Learning: Chat loop logic, pattern recognition, dialog systems.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

    Clone this repository:

    text
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-internship-repo.git
    cd ai-internship-repo

    Run Each Project:

        See the individual project folders for setup and instructions (README.md inside each folder).

        Most projects only require installing a few dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt for Python).

üí° Learning Objectives

    Build practical AI applications from scratch.

    Understand core AI/game logic (minimax, pattern matching).

    Practice with essential AI libraries (OpenCV, NLTK, etc.).

    Develop creativity and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
